# x-ray-abnormality-detection

Musculoskeletal conditions affect more than 1.7 billion people worldwide, and are the most
common cause of severe, long-term pain and disability, with 30 million emergency department
visits annually and increasing. The MURA dataset can lead to significant advances in medical
imaging technologies which can diagnose at the level of experts, towards improving healthcare
access in parts of the world where access to skilled radiologists is limited. Determining whether a
radiographic study is normal or abnormal is a critical radiological task: a study interpreted as
normal rules out disease and can eliminate the need for patients to undergo further diagnostic
procedures or interventions. Machine and Deep learning frameworks can be used for the
classification of these radiographs as normal or abnormal images. Our project focuses on
improvements on machine and deep learning frameworks for detection of abnormality in
Musculoskeletal Radiographs.
